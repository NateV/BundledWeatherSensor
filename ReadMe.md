This version connects the sensor to an Arduino, and then connects the Arduino 
directly to a Raspberry Pi. The the Arduino sends sensor data over the Serial
connection to the Pi. The Pi is running a simple script that reads the Serial input
and then stores the temperature and humidity information in a mongo database.
